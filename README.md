# Refactor of existing HTML and CSS

This challenge puts to use the skills we learned with Git, HTML, and CSS. It asked us to follow a simulated ticket to make the website more accessible and the code better organized.
The CSS in particular was very disorganized and redundant. 

> when I view source code, I find semantic HTML Elements

I changed the use of `div` to specific semantic HTML elements such as `main` `section` `article` and `footer`

> When I view the structure of HTML elements, I find logical structure

HTML follows a natural progression that is reflected in the end product and easy to read

> When I view image elements, I see alt attributes

I added alt attributes that are concise and descriptive

> When I view heading attribute, They fall in sequentioal order

The boilerplate is in the correct sequence

> When I view title element, I see a descriptive title

I changed the title from website to a descriptive title as requested

## CSS

The CSS for this website was redundant and not in a logical order. I cleaned up the code and made notes for the improvements.

## What I Learned

I feel that I have a better grasp on coding with semantic HTML versus using `div`. Picking the right semantic element made me think about the parts of the website and how to best describe them to a developer that looks at the code after me.

I also appreciated the opportunity to sharpen my CSS skills in making sure the code was clean and efficient. It was a good task to improve my notation in the actual code.
